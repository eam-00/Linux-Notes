Remove cache packages:
sudo pacman -Sc

Remove all files from the cache, use the clean switch twice, this is the most aggressive approach and will leave nothing in the cache folder:
sudo pacman -Scc

Update:
sudo pacman -Syu

The extra y forces the package manager to download package database regardless of whether there is any change in the versions or not.
This is helpful when you have a corrupted package database and you want to force a synchronization:
sudo pacman -Syyu
